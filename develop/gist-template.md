# Matching an Email

This tutorial will break down a regex (regular expression) that finds all emails in a text. 


## Summary

In each section below, you will be able to see different parts of a regex. Each part in the algorithim has a specific role in allowing a user to locate all emails in a text. 

We will be evaluating and analyzing the following Regex algorithim:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
